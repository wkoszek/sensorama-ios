# YouTube video description template

This video shows a early usability test for the Sensorama iOS
(http://www.sensorama.org). The person being interviewed is anonymous. The
phone was iPhone 6s. Tests conducted in the cafe shop, in real-world
conditions (limited light, a lot of noise). People were shortly introduced
to the app, and then I showed them paper prototypes of the UI.

Things to improve:

- the way I explain Sensorama, 
- explanation of "app", "sensors", "data"

Things which were fine:

- nobody complained about quality of the paper prototype
